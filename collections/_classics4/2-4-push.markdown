Once agin, we are taking the major lifts and reducing the rep range to 8. Up that weight!

## Routine

| Focus | Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Shoulders|Barbell Press|3|8|
|Chest|Dips|3|8|
|Traps|Dumbbell Shurgs|3|12|
|Chest|Incline Dumbbell Press|3|8|
|Shoulders|Dumbbell Front Raises|3|12|
|Triceps|Single Arm Pulldowns|3|8|
|Legs|Deadlift|5|8|

## Notes

- For these heavier single arm pulldowns, I'd recommend a neutral grip (similar to hammer curl grip).
  - You can usually just grab the end of the cable to use a neutral grip.
