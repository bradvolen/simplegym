We're going to lower the bicep curl reps too! Hit them hard!

## Routine

| Focus | Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Back|Pull-ups|3|5|
|Back|Dumbbell Rows|5|5|
|Biceps|Dumbbell curls|3|8|
|Back|Reverse Cable Flies|3|12|
|Biceps|EZ-Curl bar curls|3|8|
|Biceps|EZ-Curl bar curls|1|3 drops|

## Notes

- The last exercise should be 1 round of 3 drops sets
  - Grab 3 bars -- one you can do 10 reps, 15 reps, and 20 reps.
  - Do the heaviest until you hit failure, the middle until failure, and then the lightest until failure.
  - No rest between.
