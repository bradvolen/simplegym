Our final week will allow for some progress tracking. Try to beat your starting points in week 1/2/3.

## Routine 

| Focus | Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Chest|Bench Press|5|10,8,5,5,5|
|Shoulders|Seated Dumbbell Press|3|12|
|Chest|Cable flies|3|8|
|Shoulders|Lateral Dumbbell Raises|3|8|
|Triceps|Cable rope pulldowns|3|12|

## Notes

- It'll likely be hard to beat your starting 5 rep 3 sets deep; but give it a go.
  - If you really want to beat it, try to rest 5 minutes between the initial sets.
