Push day number two!

## Routine

| Focus | Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Shoulders|Barbell Press|3|10|
|Chest|Dips|3|12|
|Traps|Dumbbell Shurgs|3|12|

## Notes

- If you can perform the dips easily, try them weighted!
- If you can't perform the dips:
  - Some gyms will have an assisted dip machine. These are okay, but not great.
  - I really like standing decline cable presses. Do those instead (maybe even if you can do dips)
- The single arm pulldowns shoulder either be done:
  - with a neutral grip (like a hammer curl)
  - with palm facing upward
