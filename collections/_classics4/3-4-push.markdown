Once agin, we are taking the major lifts and reducing the rep range to 8. Up that weight!

## Routine

| Focus | Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Shoulders|Barbell Press|3|5|
|Chest|Dips|3|12|
|Traps|Dumbbell Shurgs|3|12|
|Chest|Incline Dumbbell Press|3|8|
|Shoulders|Dumbbell Front Raises|3|12|
|Triceps|Single Arm Pulldowns|3|8|
|Legs|Deadlift|5|5|

## Notes

- We are only doing 3x5 for shoulder press because I find the shoulders usually fatigue quickly.
  - If you are feeling bossy, go for 5x5.
