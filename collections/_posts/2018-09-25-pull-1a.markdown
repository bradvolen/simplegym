Welcome to day 2 of the cycle!
We are going to be doing a back and bicep workout today.

## Routine

1. Back
  - Pull-ups 3x10
2. Back
  - Bent over dumbell rows 3x10
3. Biceps
  - Dumbbell curls 3x12
4. Back
  - Reverse Cable Flies 3x12
5. Biceps
  - EZ-Curl bar curls 3x12
6. Biceps/Forearms
  - EZ-Curl bar reverse curls 3x12

## Notes

- If you are unable to perform 5+ pull-ups, you can substitute with:
  - Pull-up negatives
  - Pull-downs
- Try to keep rest around 2 minutes between sets. More time may be needed for the pull-ups.
