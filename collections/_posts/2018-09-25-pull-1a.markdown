Welcome to day 2 of the cycle!
We are going to be doing a back and bicep workout today.

## Routine

| Focus | Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Back|Pull-ups|3|10|
|Back|Dumbbell Rows|3|10|
|Biceps|Dumbbell curls|3|12|
|Back|Reverse Cable Flies|3|12|
|Biceps|EZ-Curl bar curls|3|12|
|Biceps/Forearms|EZ-Curl bar reverse curls|3|12|

## Notes

- If you are unable to perform 5+ pull-ups, you can substitute with:
  - Pull-up negatives
  - Pull-downs
- Try to keep rest around 2 minutes between sets. More time may be needed for the pull-ups.
