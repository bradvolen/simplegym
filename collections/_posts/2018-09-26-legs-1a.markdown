It's the first leg day!
We're going to be doing legs and abs today; because why not.

## Routine

1. Legs
  - Squats (or leg press) 5x10
2. Abs
  - Rope pulldown crunces 3x15
3. Legs
  - Lunges (step backwards!) 3x10
4. Legs/Glutes/Lower Back (weighted if 12 is easy)
  - Back Extensions 3x12
5. Abs
  - 1 minute plank, 30 sec plank both sides x 2
6. Legs
  - Calf raises 3x10

## Notes

- I don't really care if you do squats or leg presses. Try them both, alternate day to day, whatever
- Lunges should be 10 for each leg
- Calf raises can be done:
  - Barbell on back
  - Leg press machine
  - Holding dumbbells
  - Most gyms have machines specifically for calves too!
