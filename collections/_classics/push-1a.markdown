The first workout of the site; here we go!

As it should be, we will start with a chest/shoulder/tri workout:

## Routine

|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Chest|Bench Press|3|10|
|Shoulders|Seated Dumbbell Press|3|10|
|Chest|Cable flies|3|12|
|Shoulders|Lateral Dumbbell Raises|3|12|
|Chest|Pushups|2|To failure|
|Triceps|Cable rope pulldowns|3|12|

## Notes

- Rest for about 2 minutes between sets.
- Try to not hit failure until the last set of a given movement.
