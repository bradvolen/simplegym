It's the first leg day!
We're going to be doing legs and abs today; because why not.

## Routine

| Focus | Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Legs|Back Squats|5|10|
|Abs|Rope Pulldown Crunches|3|15|
|Legs|Step Back Lunges|3|10|
|Glutes|Back Extensions|3|12|
|Calves|Calf Raises|3|12|
|Abs|Plank + Side Plank|2|60+30+30 seconds|

## Notes

- When choosing squats or leg press
  - Squats are probably better if you are hoping for translation to athletics
  - Leg Press is good enough if you care mainly about building muscle and/or are concerned about injury
- Lunges should be 10 for each leg
- Calf raises can be done:
  - Barbell on back
  - Leg press machine
  - Holding dumbbells
  - Most gyms have machines specifically for calves too!
