## Notes

- If you can perform the amount of chin-ups prescribed, try weighted chin-ups!
- If you cannot perform more tha 5 chinups:
  - Some gyms will have assisted chin-up machines
  - Use a pulley machine and do pulldowns with a chin-up grip.
- If your chin-up holds exceed a 45 seconds, consider performing them weighted.
- Barbell rows can be rough on your lower back. Be certain to maintain good form. Don't worry about going too heavy.
