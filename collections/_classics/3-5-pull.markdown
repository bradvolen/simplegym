Remember, if you can, try the chin-ups with some extra weight!

## Routine

| Focus | Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Back|Chin-ups|3|8|
|Back|V-Grip Cable Rows|5|5|
|Biceps|Hammer curls|3|8|
|Biceps|Reclined Seated Curls|3|12|
|Back|Straight Arm Lat Pulldown|3|12|
|Back|Chin-up holds|2|to failure|

## Notes

- If the rows are tough at this weight. Bump it back up to 8 reps per set.
- If you feel up to for it, add weight to the final chin-up holds. They won't be as long, but they'll be good for you!
